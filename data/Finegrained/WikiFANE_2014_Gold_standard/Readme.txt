The gold-standard fine-grained Arabic named entity corpora is a resource created manually by annotating NEs in the context into 50 fine-grained classes. 
The annotation uses two-levels taxonomy in which an entity has been annotated into coarse- and fine-grained classes.

We call the corpora:
===========================================================================
WikiFANEGold: Gold standard Wikipedia-based Fine-grained Arabic Named Entity Corpus
and
NewsFANEGold: Gold standard Newswire-based Fine-grained Arabic Named Entity Corpus.
===========================================================================

Those corpora have been manually annotated from the Arabic Wikipedia and Newswire sources respectively. 

More details about those corpora is fully described in the paper:

F. Alotaibi and M. Lee, "A Hybrid Approach to Features Representation for Fine-grained Arabic Named Entity Recognition", In Proceedings of COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29. 2014.
